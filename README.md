# World-Happiness-Report

We would like to investigate what has been driving happiness rates worldwide in the past few years. We will be looking at levels of freedom, income, etc., and their impact on happiness. For additional datasets, we will be on the lookout for other social-economic datasets regarding religions or tolerance, and so on. These datasets will assist us in creating a story for what could help a person in their pursuit of happiness.

The initial dataset weâ€™ve selected comes from Kaggle and gives information about levels of freedom, GDP, and a happiness score by country.
